# Sign_language_detection
Sign Language Detection uses machine learning and computer vision to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text or speech. By training models on datasets of sign language gestures (e.g., ASL), the system can identify signs from video or images, helping bridge communication gaps between deaf and non-deaf individuals.
